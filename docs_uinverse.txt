Listing repositories

To see which package repositories are currently installed, enter this CLI command:

dcos package repo list
Universe: https://universe.mesosphere.com/repo


Searching for packages

To search for packages, run this CLI command:

dcos package search [--json <query>]
For example, this command searches for big data packages:

dcos package search "big data"
NAME   VERSION        SELECTED  FRAMEWORK  DESCRIPTION                                                                       
spark  1.0.9-2.1.0-1  True      False      Spark is a fast and general cluster computing system for Big Data.  


Adding a Repository

To add a repo, run this command:

dcos package repo add <repo-name> <repo-url>
For example, this command adds a repo named your-repo with the URL https://universe.yourcompany.com/repo:

dcos package repo add your-repo https://universe.yourcompany.com/repo


or full instructions on how to build and run your own Universe repo see the Universe Server Documentation

Removing a Repository

To remove a repo, run this command:

dcos package repo remove <repo-name>
For example, this command removes a repo named your-repo:

dcos package repo remove your-repo


-------------------- local install ----------------------------------------------------------
Because DC/OS 1.9 is not the latest release, you will need to build your own local Universe image. Follow these instructions, skipping step 3.
Use secure copy to transfer the Universe and registry files to a master node. Replace <master-IP> with the public IP address of a master before issuing the following commands.

Tip: You can find the public IP address of a master in the top left corner of the DC/OS web interface.

scp local-universe.tar.gz core@<master-IP>:~
scp dcos-local-universe-http.service core@<master-IP>:~
scp dcos-local-universe-registry.service core@<master-IP>:~
SSH into the master using the following command. Replace <master-IP> with the IP address used in the previous commands.
ssh -A core@<master-IP> 
Confirm that the files were successfully copied.
ls
You should see the following files listed.
dcos-local-universe-http.service  dcos-local-universe-registry.service  local-universe.tar.gz
Move the registry files into the /etc/systemd/system/ directory.
sudo mv dcos-local-universe-registry.service /etc/systemd/system/
sudo mv dcos-local-universe-http.service /etc/systemd/system/
Confirm that the files were successfully copied into /etc/systemd/system/.
ls -la /etc/systemd/system/
Load the Universe into the local Docker instance.
docker load < local-universe.tar.gz
Tip: This may take some time to complete.

Restart the systemd daemon.

sudo systemctl daemon-reload
Enable and start the dcos-local-universe-http and dcos-local-universe-registry services.
systemctl enable dcos-local-universe-http
systemctl enable dcos-local-universe-registry
sudo systemctl start dcos-local-universe-http     
sudo systemctl start dcos-local-universe-registry
Use the following commands to confirm that the services are now up and running.
sudo systemctl status dcos-local-universe-http
sudo systemctl status dcos-local-universe-registry
If you only have one master, skip to step 25. If you have multiple masters, continue to the next step.
Use the following command to discover the private IP addresses of all of your masters. Identify the private IP address of the master you are SSHed into right now from the list.

Tip: It will match the path shown after core@ip- in your prompt, where the hyphens become periods.

host master.mesos
Use secure copy to transfer the Universe and registry files to one of the other masters. Replace <master-IP> with the IP address of the other master.
scp local-universe.tar.gz core@<master-IP>:~
scp /etc/systemd/system/dcos-local-universe-registry.service core@<master-IP>:~
scp /etc/systemd/system/dcos-local-universe-http.service core@<master-IP>:~
SSH into the master that you just copied these files to.
ssh -A core@<master_IP>
Confirm that the files were successfully copied.
ls
You should see the following files listed.
dcos-local-universe-http.service  dcos-local-universe-registry.service  local-universe.tar.gz
Move the registry files into the /etc/systemd/system/ directory.
sudo mv dcos-local-universe-registry.service /etc/systemd/system/
sudo mv dcos-local-universe-http.service /etc/systemd/system/
Confirm that the files were successfully copied into /etc/systemd/system/.
ls -la /etc/systemd/system/
Load the Universe into the local Docker instance.
docker load < local-universe.tar.gz
Tip: This may take some time to complete.

Restart the Docker daemon.

sudo systemctl daemon-reload
Start the dcos-local-universe-http and dcos-local-universe-registry services.
sudo systemctl start dcos-local-universe-http
sudo systemctl start dcos-local-universe-registry
Use the following commands to confirm that the services are now up and running.
sudo systemctl status dcos-local-universe-http
sudo systemctl status dcos-local-universe-registry
Repeat steps 14 through 23 until you have completed this procedure for all of your masters. Then continue to the next step.
Close the SSH session by typing exit or open a new terminal prompt tab.

Tip: You may have to exit more than one SSH session if you have multiple masters.

(Optional) Use the following command to remove the references to the default Universe from your cluster. If you want to leave the default Universe in place and just add the local Universe as an additional repository, you can skip to the next step.

dcos package repo remove Universe
Tip: You can also remove the references to the default Universe repository from Settings > Repositories in the DC/OS web interface.

Use the following command to add a reference to the new local Universes that you added to each master.

dcos package repo add local-universe http://master.mesos:8082/repo
SSH into one of your agent nodes.
dcos node ssh --master-proxy --mesos-id=<mesos-id>
Use the following commands to download a copy of the DC/OS certificate locally and set it as trusted.
sudo mkdir -p /etc/docker/certs.d/master.mesos:5000
sudo curl -o /etc/docker/certs.d/master.mesos:5000/ca.crt http://master.mesos:8082/certs/domain.crt
sudo systemctl restart docker
Close the SSH session by typing exit or open a new terminal prompt tab. Repeat steps 28 and 29 on each agent node.
To verify your success, log into the DC/OS web interface and open the Universe > Packages tab. You should see a list of selected packages. Go ahead and try to install one of the packages.

FAQ

I cant install CLI subcommands

Packages are hosted at master.mesos:8082. If you cannot resolve or connect to master.mesos:8082 from your DC/OS CLI install, you cannot install CLI subcommands. If you can connect to port 8082 on your masters, add the IP for one of the masters to /etc/hosts.

The images are broken

All Universe components are hosted inside of your cluster, including the images. The components are served up by master.mesos:8082. If you have connectivity to that IP, you can add it to /etc/hosts and get the images working.

I dont see the package I was looking for

By default, only the selected packages are bundled. If youd like to get something else, use the build your own instructions.

Installing your own set of Universe packages

Prerequisite: Git. On Unix/Linux, see these installation instructions.

To install your own set of packages you must build a customized local Universe Docker image.

Clone the Universe repository:
git clone https://github.com/mesosphere/universe.git --branch version-3.x
Build the universe-base image:
cd universe/docker/local-universe/
sudo make base
Build the mesosphere/universe Docker image and compress it to the local-universe.tar.gz
file. Specify a comma-separated list of package names and versions using the DCOS_PACKAGE_INCLUDE
variable. To minimize the container size and download time, you can select only what you need. If
you do not use the DCOS_PACKAGE_INCLUDE variable, all selected Universe packages will be
included. To view which packages are selected, click on the Universe tab in the DC/OS web
interface.
sudo make DCOS_VERSION=1.9 DCOS_PACKAGE_INCLUDE="cassandra:1.0.25-3.0.10,marathon:1.4.2" local-universe
Perform all of the steps as described in Installing the default Universe packages section, except step 27. Replace the command in step 27 with the following.
dcos package repo add local-universe http://master.mesos:8082/repo
